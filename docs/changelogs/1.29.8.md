# BlitzKit 1.29.8

Thank you to [Mark Greene](https://github.com/Hitjack007) for your contribution this update.

## Features

- Added an option to clear provisions and consumables from all tanks in Compare
- Added the ability to choose stock turrets and guns in Mixer if a tank has any
- Added streaks to Guesser
- Introduced an option to partially reveal tanks in Guesser
  - This removes the darkness effect but keeps the name hidden
  - This will reset your streak to 0
  - Regardless of getting the right guess on the tank's name, your response will be counted as incorrect if partially revealed

## Fixes

- The Tankopedia now smoothly resizes when enlarging on interaction
- [Mark Greene] Stock turrets now correctly mount the corresponding stock gun
- The consumable and provision buttons in Compare are no longer tiny
