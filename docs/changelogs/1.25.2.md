# BlitzKit 1.25.2

## Features

- Added custom shells
  - This shows up as a "fourth" shell below the antagonist's shells
  - Here, you can customize the shell type, caliber, and penetration
  - If the shell type is AP or APCR, you can further customize the ricochet and normalization angles

## Fixes

- The Tankopedia now renders more efficiently by not rendering frames when not needed and unnecessarily rebuilding the whole tank model
- This fix above fixes an issue where the whole tank flashed red when switching shells
