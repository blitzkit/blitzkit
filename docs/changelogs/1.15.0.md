    - Position: finds the player at that position
    - League: finds the top-most player in that league
    - Player: finds the player
    - **Jumping to scores and positions for the current season is a compounding function (hence the loading screen) and is limited to the speed of Wargaming's APIs which is pretty darn slow**
