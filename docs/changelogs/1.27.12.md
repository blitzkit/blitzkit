This update only affects the website.

## Features

- Added the ability to sort by HE shell penetration
- The Tankopedia compare bars now account for equipment and selected shells
- Made the hero section of the Tankopedia a bit shorter to show users that the page is scrollable

## Fixes

- The "Clear filters" button no longer shows up after clearing the search bar
- Guns for some tanks no longer go transparent when far away from the camera
- The dynamic armor tab no longer lags and flickers when rotating the turret of a tank
- Reimplemented the missing tool backgrounds in the navigation bar hamburger menu
- The navigation bar now properly goes transparent for pages that request like the Tankopedia pages
- Removed the tank name text outline because it doesn't work on most devices
