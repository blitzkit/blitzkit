# 1.19.0

Introducing the Blitzkrieg Compare tool!

## Features

- Added Compare
  - Allows you to compare multiple tanks
  - Shows deltas in the form of differences between values or percentages
  - All stats from the Tankopedia are available here
- [CLS](https://web.dev/articles/cls) was reduced due to the new loading screens
- Clicking enter when searching for tanks now selects the first result
  - The first tank name is also displayed in the search input

## Changes

- Removed the donation banner instead for a little note in the footer
  - The footer now shows the version of Blitzkrieg and the version of WoTB its running on
- Removed frosted glass effect from most components apart from the navigation bar for performance reasons (I am looking at you, Apple!)
