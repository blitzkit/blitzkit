# Blitzkrieg 1.3.0

This release of Blitzkrieg focuses mainly on **performance**. Blitzkrieg now uses **Satori** and **resvg** under the hood to render images resulting in a solid **2x to 8x performance boost** depending on the situation.

This only applies to `/today` and /stats` as they're the only commands that render an image currently.

We're working further on **performance optimizations**. Our goal is to deliver a message within **3 seconds or less**. We're close and we'll get there!

**Thank you to baÂ·ka**, the creator of aftermath, for telling me about Satori!
