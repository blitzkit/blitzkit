# BlitzKit 1.26.2

Two updates in a day! Why? Well, these two updates were being cooked separately in parallel and happened to have matured on the same day. Merry early Christmas!

## Features

- Highly optimized the component rerenders of the Tank Sandbox
- Implemented Google Analytics into the homepage to more accurately show the most popular tanks
- Optimized page load speeds and memory consumption by loading all data in parallel instead of sequentially

## Fixes

- Dynamic armor is now loaded in React Suspense to avoid race conditions
- Re-ordered cards on the home page so that it makes a little bit more sense
- The warnings section of the Tankopedia pages are now padded on the sides
- The calibers in the antagonist gun selector are now rounded correctly
- Tank class icons are now colored and sized properly again in the header

## Technical Changes

- Removed the extreme JPEG compression for the tank textures
- Buffers of the same length are now assumed to be identical when diffing lmao I hope this doesn't go wrong
