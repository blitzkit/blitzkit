# BlitzKit 1.21.1

One wise man said, experimental is literally in the name of experimental technology.

## Features

- Added a button on the right above the shells to quickly switch antagonist guns
- Terrain resistance coefficients are now displayed as coefficients

## Fixes

- The shot display card now once again shows up on-screen
- The shot tracer is also now correctly aligned
- Tank tracks no longer interfere with camera rotation
- "NaN" deltas don't show up in the stats section
- The default provisions algorithm has been improved so most tanks should now have the best provisions by default
- The tree type icon in the Tankopedia hero section is now colored properly
- Removed "Battles" from Tank performance as it's simply inaccurate
  - This feature will come back when player stats are released
- Tank cell headers are now more consistently sized
- Armor mode no longer causes Next.js hydration issues (even faster Tankopedia loading!)
- The antagonist selector for the Tankopedia page now once again works
