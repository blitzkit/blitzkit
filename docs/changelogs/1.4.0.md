# Blitzkrieg 1.4.0

A **few features** :star: and a **few much needed fixes** :wrench:!

## Changes

- Added an "today" row to `/today` which displays your overall statistics
- Gave `/tankstats` the new blitzkrieg look
  - Also added "today", "60 days", and "career" stats
- Added a beta warning to generated images
- Updated the logo for match the new slate theme
  - Canary versions now use the canary logo variant
- Added subtle polka dots to the background

## Fixes

- Rewrote `/stats` to precisely calculate stats on a per-tank basis
  - This should stop the bot from hallucinating about stats
  - This should also stop the bot from giving stats from like a week ago
  - Also added "60 day" stats
- Tank autocomplete is now more human-tolerant just like username autocomplete
- Titlebar discriminators are now truncated on overflow

## Technical Changes

- The bot now uses `bepaint`, a library that I made that standardizes the color palette
  - Also updated the logo to follow this
- Optimized how fonts are imported by fetching them all asynchronously
