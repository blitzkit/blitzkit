# BlitzKit 1.29.12

## Fixes

- BlitzKit no longer uses BlitzStars for tank averages for some commands
  - BlitzKit Performance was created to completely replace BlitzStars but BlitzStars was still used for some older commands
  - But since BlitzStars keeps having downtime, it has been completely removed
- Upgraded all dependencies to the latest versions
- The replay command is now properly localized across all languages
- Special Chinese characters are now properly handled
- Commands are now registered synchronously, allowing errors to reveal their exact origins
- Error handling now properly exists the process after logging the error
- The bot now uses Discord's new `clientReady` instead of the ambagious `ready` event
- Both the armor and model extractors now use the new BlitzKit `SteamVFS`
