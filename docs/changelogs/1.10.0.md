# Blitzkrieg 1.10.0

This update addresses many readability issues that users have reported over time.

## Changes

- `/ownedtanks`
  - Tanks are now displayed in two columns
  - Collector and premium tanks now have their own colors
  - Tank types are also displayed
  - A stylistic image of the tank is also displayed for each tank to the right
- `/fullstats`
  - Was previously called `/statsfull`; this was changed to avoid the clutter that would show up when searching for `/stats`
  - Added four catagories in which all the stats are sorted into
  - Catagories now have backgrounds to compartmentalize them
- `/evolution`
  - Gave the axis markings a high contrast color
  - Added a label for the x axis affirming that it is plotted over the number of battles
- `/today`
  - Added a border to all the rows to compartmentalize them
  - This command can now generate embeds too
  - Removed survivability
  - Added a limit option to cut off after a certain number of tanks played (this is mainly intended to be used by streamers to limit the content of the embeds)
  - Tanks are now displayed in order of the most recent battle
- `/help`
  - A significant amount of subcommands were added
  - These new subcommands now return normal Discord messages instead of embeds in favor of readability
  - The contents of the replies are directly fetched from the Blitzkrieg documentation
- Time zones
  - What is considered a "day's worth of battles" has been adjusted as the "reset time" was the same for all Blitz servers
  - The reset time is now dependent on the server of the player
  - Use `/help timezones` to learn more

## Technical Changes

- All themes have been merged to leverage Bepaint's suffixes
- Switched to Node module resolution
