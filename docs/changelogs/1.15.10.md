# Blitzkrieg 1.15.10

The 10th patch for the `1.15` update is here, breaking the record of the most patches for a single update!

## Features

- Added `/today`
  - This is a direct alias for `/breakdown today`
- Drastically simplified ratings command
  - `/ratings current` and `/ratings archive` have been now merged
  - Where the data is fetched from is now decided directly from the chosen season number
- Simplified many error messages
- Title bar description text is now centered when there is no image
  - It always felt awkward when there was no image on the left but the left still aligned to the right
- Removed `/link`'s requirement to select a username explicitly from the search results
- Full names for regions are now used in the `/link` command
  - So "NA" turns into "North America"

## Fixes

- Fixed contrast issues with WN8 percentile colors behind white text
- Archived ratings neighbors now functions once again
