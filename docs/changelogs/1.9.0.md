# Blitzkrieg 1.9.0

The biggest, the baddest update yet!

## Changes

- Spiced up `/stats` with a graphics update
  - This command now only shows a few of the stats as most of them were pretty pointless
- Renamed the old `/stats` to `/statsfull`
- Added embeds for `/stats`
  - This is a URL that can be visited to load a "naked" variant of the command that auto-refreshes with the latest data every `60` seconds meant to be used the streamers
- Added refresh buttons to a few commands
  - This lets you reuse a command on the click of a button
- Fixed many readibility issues with `/evolution` thanks to @heldenklage

## Fixes

- Fixed several type issues for compatibility with `express`

## Technical Changes

- Added a seperate `server.ts` from `bot.ts`
  - Split builds appropriately
- Added the ability for routes to respond with svg counterparts of commands
- Cached `tankopedia.json` and `tankaverages.json` at build time
  - This may be reverted in a minor release i favor of `Promise<Tankopedia>`
- Organized files as it was important to seperate the server and the bot code
- Split `resolvePeriod` and `resolvePlayer` for command, button, and express counterparts
- Switched a few instances of `Number(...)` to `parseInt(...)` and `parseLong(...)`
- Disabled canary commands for the public
- Merged `poweredBy` footers
- `dist` now ships with a `package.json` for Cyclic
