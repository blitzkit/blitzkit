# BlitzKit 1.22.1

## Features

- Legendary camouflage names are now included in the Tankopedia search (for example, you can search up "Shark" and the T54E2 will show up)
- Provision and consumable buttons in the Tankopedia and Compare tools are now separate buttons

## Fixes

- The name and icons of tanks in the Tankopedia search page are now properly aligned and trimmed
- The Tankopedia search is now stricter; thus, filters out nonsensical results
- The most optimal shell index once again shows the correct index
- The DPM listing is now in parity with the game which is what "Max DPM" used to be previously
- The Max DPM value is now also correct since the optimal shell index has been corrected
- The mastery of crew members who play a secondary role in the tank is now handled properly
- The turret of tanks cannot be accidentally rotated when dragging over other objects (like the body of the tank)
- Penetrations are once again calculated after a ricochet
- Camouflage values are now calculated properly when the Camouflage Net equipment is applied
- Removed the redundant Configure tab when selecting an antagonist tank
