# BlitzKit 1.27.19

Two updates in a day? I just got a little excited by the new Tankopedia lighting.

## Features

- The camera is now lower town in the Tankopedia, giving the tank a more heroic feel
- Tanks are better framed across all devices, minimizing whitespace
- Added a skip button for the reload visualizer to skip to the next event

## Fixes

- Removed the useless "show grid" setting
- Taking screenshots now no longer includes the scene props like the floor
- The subtler color contrast for the advanced highlighting has now been reverted back to the higher contrast
- The shot display card is now properly aligned as a proper table again
- Tank modules are once again considered in the penetration tester
- Tank filters in the antagonist selector in the Tankopedia sandbox are now properly aligned
