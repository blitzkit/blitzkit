# Blitzkrieg 1.11.0

I am going on vacation so I thought I'd publish this a bit prematurely without all the planned features.

## Changes

- Added `/ratings`
  - This command currently only has the `leagues` subcommand group
  - Displays the top players in a league
  - Also shows the changes in their positions and scores since last region midnight
  - Use `/help timezones` to know when Blitzkrieg records the leaderboard
- Blitzkrieg now internally generates and keeps a permanent record of all leaderboards updated every `UTC+0` midnight
  - This approach will allow us to capture the absolute latest state of the leaderboard before it is wiped for the next season

## Fixed

- Removed region "Europe" in `/verify` example

## Technical Changes

- Add scripts were upgraded to TypeScript
- Secrets now only throw errors if they're used when not provided
