# Blitzkrieg 1.12.0

_Houston, permission to return to Earth? A new update dropped._

## Features

- Added `multi-tank` filters to `/stats` and `/full-stats`
  - This lets you pull up the stats by combining filters of `nation`, `tank-type`, `tier`, and `tree-type`
- Added `/ratings neighbours`
  - Lets you see your rank and the neighbours around you
- Added a bunch more `/today` parameters (thank you for the suggestions, HisRoyalFatness!)
  - `cutoff`: the max number of rows to show (excluding the total row)
  - `maximized`: the max number of rows that show the full non-collapsed stats (default: `4`)
  - `show-total`: show the total row or not (default: `true`)
- Tank search is now accent-tolerant

## Changes

- `/ratings` has been moved out of preview and is now accessible to all
- `/today` now has a more appealing look with more efficient space management
- `/stats`, `/full-stats`, and `/evolution` now have less convoluted commands
  - All periods now fall under `period` and `custom`
  - `period` has preset periods like `today`, `career`, `30`, `60`, `90`
  - `custom` lets you set a start and end day
- Added dashes to command names, subcommands, options, etc. to make them more readable
- Titlebar
  - Removed the Blitzkrieg logo
  - Removed region
  - Center aligned items
- Footers are now center alinged when they do no have footer text on the left
- Moved several title discriminators into the description
- `/ratings` is now data-driven
- Embeds now auto refresh every `30` seconds instead of `60`
- Added numbers besides roman numerals in tier choice
  - I forgot to implement this in places other than `/owned-tanks`... oh well!
- Increased precision of winrate in `/evolution` to `2` decimals

## Fixes

- Removed duplicate "Efficiency" cards in `/full-stats`
- Titlebar gap is now `4px` just like Figma
- Renamed `/statsfull` to `/full-stats` in the `/stats` footer
- Rewards in `/ratings` are now properly aligned
- `/ratings` now uses the correct source of information per region instead of getting it from a cached North American source
- Search parameters are now passed onto the URL parser correctly
- Custom date ranges now work correctly once again as the start is now the maximum days ago from today and the end is the minimum

## Technical Changes

- All generated images are now `480px` wide instead of `640px` to combat the unnecessary amounts of negative space
- Changed all relevant typings to be sourced from `stats` instead of `full-stats`
- Added minimum character limit to clan search
- Username auto-completing now only takes in regex-accepted parts of the input
- Search parameters are now longer automatically generated by inferring command interactions
