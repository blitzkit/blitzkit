# Blitzkrieg 1.5.2

Quite a few **bug fixes** with a **bunch more** on their way next update!

## Fixes

- Disabled image encoding as it seems to have broken in `1.5.0` and simply spams the console now
- `/stats` now ignores tanks that don't have any averages
  - Tanks may not have averages registered in Blitz Stars because they are new or are in testing
  - Take a look at \_34's testing tanks in the image below
- Fixed the "large image" prompt by simply removing the whole prompt
  - _Kaboom? Yes Rico, kaboom._
- `/today` now displays `--` when there is no WN8 to display
  - This is unlike `/stats` which just shows 0 (this will be fixed soon)
