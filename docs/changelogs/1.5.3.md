# Blitzkrieg 1.5.3

Just a few more fixes that weren't that important so were deffered to this update.

## Fixes

- `/stats` now uses `--` just like `/today` when WN8 is not available
- Removed an unnecessary try/catch during the execution of a command
- Added error handling for an edge case where accounts with 0 battles were looked up
  - This only applies to when `api/tanks/stats` is fetched; most other commands still need this fix
