## Features

- Added the Tank performance tool which lists all tanks in the game and how players are performing in them
  - This tool features the same tank filters as the Tankopedia search page
  - The number of players in any given period can be viewed by switching the period from the dropdown
  - This list updated daily
- The tankopedia search page now loads much faster
  - Not all tanks are loaded at once; rather, more tanks are loaded as you scroll down the page (the same as Tank performance)
  - The tank pages also load lightning fast now

## Fixes
