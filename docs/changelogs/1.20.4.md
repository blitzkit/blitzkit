# BlitzKit 1.20.4

Continuing the revamping UI train, this release tanks the tank search page.

## Changes

- Tanks are now displayed naked, not bounded by a button
- The filters are now far more compact, responsive, and intuitive
- The search bar is now faster and shows skeletons when loading
- The sort feature now displays the values of tanks used to sort underneath the tank's names
- Nations are now ordered in the way they are in-game
- When filtering tanks in testing, a work-in-progress warning is shown
- When there are no results, a proper message is shown
