# Blitzkrieg 1.16.3

Further polishing and corrections for the Tankopedia.

## Features

- Added a few more stats to view for the Tankopedia
  - Added the count of shells in the magazine for auto-reloaders
    - The optimal shell index was moved below this stats
  - Shell reloads for auto-reloaders now abide crew stats
  - Intra-clip is now also shown for auto-reloaders
- Added 1 more decimal place worth of precision when viewing and changing gun pitch and yaw

## Fixes

- "Inter-clip" is now correctly spelled as "intra-clip"
- Tanks with initial gun pitches (like the Minotauro) are now handled correctly
  - The stats now reflect the fact that the gun is naturally pitched downwards
  - The view model now compensates for the natural pitch
- Tanks with the improved vertical stabilizer equipment are now handled correctly
  - The view model now allows you to pitch the gun further as intended when the equipment is on
