# Blitzkrieg 1.7.6

Public service announcements and a few developer quality-of-life changes.

## Changes

- Added a PSA system
  - Lets me create announcements without having to release a new update every single time
- Added fixed choices for tank stats instead of typing in numbers like before

## Technical Changes

- Command executions now return a payload and the executor now fully handles the interaction replies
- The build script now skips certain steps to speed up building time when building in dev mode
