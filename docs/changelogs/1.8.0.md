# Blitzkrieg 1.8.0

A slick new command and new potentials unlocked.

## Changes

- Added `/ping`
  - Allows you to see if the bot and Blitz are alive
- Added custom periods for `/stats`
  - To do this, `/stats` received two sub command groups: `/stats player` and `/stats tank` (hence merging the two)
  - All periods, including cusotm ones, now live as subcommands
- Added tier weights to `/stats`
- Added `/evolution`
  - Shows your winrate and battles over a period

## Fixes

- `Infinity` and `NaN` values now show up as `--` in `/stats`
- WN8 shortcomings in `/eligible` now rounds to nearest integer
- Average tiers now, once again, show up in `/stats`

## Technical Changes

- Dev command names are implemented centrally in `interactionCreated`
- Abstracted the renderers of `/stats`, `/evolution`, and `/today`
- The bot now logs the number of server it's in on start up
