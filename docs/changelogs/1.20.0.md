# BlitzKit 1.20.0

**IMPORTANT FOR STREAMERS:** This version removed the session tracker embed. Embeds will be reintroduced in the future.

## Features

- Reworked session tracker
  - Played tanks are now displayed as a clean table that fits the theme of the website
  - Tank images are now displayed along with them being linked to their respective tankopedia pages
  - The UI has been simplified
  - You can also change what columns are shown in the table but this is a work in progress feature
- Added the `/replay` command
  - This command uploads your replays to WOTINSPECTOR and displays the battle results

## Fixes

- Fixed the logo of the website to have a capital "K"
