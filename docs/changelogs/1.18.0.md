# Blitzkrieg 1.18.0

Introducing the new `/rating` command!

## Features

- `/rating` command
  - Features statistics on today's performance in ratings
  - The included stats are battles, winrate, damage, survival, and kills
  - This command also features the score, rank, and league you are at plus the reward you'll get if you are high enough on the leaderboard
- `/ratings`, the old leaderboard command, has been renamed `/rating-leaderboard`
  - Reward icons have been removed from the leaderboard

## Technical Changes

- Rating leaderboards are now built in a more action-efficient manner.
  - This version also introduces the BKRL (Blitzkrieg rating leaderboard) file format which is an efficient way to store entire leaderboards of regions to disk (1 MB per 40,000 users).
  - Latest archival actions now build all regions at once in a single action.
- The sharp module is now included in the build.
