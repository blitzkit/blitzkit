# 1.19.4

I genuinely have no idea how these bugs sneaked in here. This update only affects the website.

## Features

- Added a button in Compare which links to the corresponding Tankopedia page
- Added a button in Tankopedia that links to the corresponding Compare page
  - If the two tanks (the shooter and the one of which armor is displayed) in the Tankopedia are different, they will be both added by default in the Compare page
- Simplified the footer and added a link to my website and the credits page
- Added an aggressive donate button right at the top of the home page

## Fixes

Thanks to mi≈°ek for these bug reports!

- The intra-clip time is now displayed for auto-loaders
- High End Consumables now increase the duration of consumables correctly instead of decreasing it
