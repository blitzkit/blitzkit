# Blitzkrieg 1.9.3

A few fixes before we tackle the next major release.

## Fixes

- `/stats`, `/evolution`, and `/statsfull` now properly handle unowned or unplayed tanks

## Technical Changes

- Added a `Command` suffix after all command exports
- Added a `Route` suffix after all route exports
- Moved `tankopedia` and `tankaverages` into a runtime cache
  - But, this time, it's a promise so we get the best of both worlds
