# Blitzkrieg 1.18.3

Making Tankopedia more pleasing to use. This update only affects the website.

## Features

- Added crew skills
- Added quick actions
  - For example, crew skills have the "clear" and "maximize" actions and equipment simply has a "clear" action
- Added info buttons
  - Beside the titles of a few sections, a new info buttons have been added for extended descriptions
- Tank configurations have been condensed thanks to a new layout that works well on most screen sizes
- The Tankopedia now takes advantage of wider screens than before; hence, getting rid of the useless whitespaces on the sides
- Tank modules are now neatly wrapped into dropdown menus
- Sorting tanks by "size" has been renamed to "volume" and length has been added as a new option
- The antagonist (the shooting tank) bar has been shrunk to only fit the its contents
- Fullscreen mode now features all the missing dropdowns and options that were previously hidden
- Added icons for donations on Patreon and Ko-fi in the navigation bar
- Tank search now uses regular links allowing for things like opening in new tabs, copying links, etc.

## Fixes

- Armor highlighting once again works properly even after switching around tank modules
- Inputting invalid numbers into the pitch and yaw fields is now handled correctly
- Removed unnecessary tooltips that didn't show up anyway due to Radix UI 3

## Technical Changes
