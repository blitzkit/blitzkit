## Features

- Added Croatian, Russian, Ukrainian, and Chinese

- Increased the maximum recently viewed tanks list size to 14
- Tweaked the tank name in the hero section of the Tankopedia to allow the tank to be in the center of the page
- The headers in the Performance tool are now sticky just like the Compare tool

## Fixes
