# BlitzKit 1.28.0

BlitzKit, as an app and the new Mixer tool!

## Features

- Created the BlitzKit app that can be downloaded on most devices
- Re-did the BlitzKit logo to be a bit warmer
- Added the Mixer tool which lets you combine tank models into Frankensteins
- Updated all dependencies to the latest version for a decent performance boost

## Fixes

- BlitzKit no longer forgets persistent data if the app crashes without properly closing
- The tools list in the navbar no longer overflows into the neighboring elements on certain devices
- Added keying to a few places, speeding up re-rendering
