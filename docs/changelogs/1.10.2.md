# Blitzkrieg 1.10.2

The experiment in Blitzkrieg `1.10.1` was a bit of a failure so here are a few changes.

## Fixes

- North American leaderboards are now saved in the `na` directory instead of `asia`
- Dependencies are now installed before the script is ran
- Added leaderboards for all regions
- All regions now have their own separate cron timings
