# BlitzKit 1.27.17

This update was released early for the website. Today, it'll be officially announced and released for the bot

## Features

- Added the shell reload visualizer to aid people in getting a feel for how long shell reloads really are
- Added lines of stats for the burst shells

## Changes

- Removed the redundant word "Shell" from "Shell reload" and "Shell reloads"
- Removed the penetration over distance slider

## Fixes

- Fixed the DPM of tanks with burst shells like the ATAC
  - The DPM will still be different from the game due to a bug in World of Tanks Blitz; I am trying to get Wargaming to fix it; trust BlitzKit!
