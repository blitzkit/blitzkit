# Blitzkrieg 1.15.7

Simple yet powerful theming options for the session tracker

## Features

- The accent color of the session tracker (hence the embed too) can now be tweaked
  - Access this setting via the dropdown from Options > Accent color

## Fixes

- Reimplemented the commas for last numbers in the overflow count of the ratings leaderboard
  - For example, "+1234567 more" will now read "+1,234,567 more"

## Technical Features

- Added class names for more in-depth customization for those who are comfortable with CSS
  - `session-tracker-root`
  - `session-tracker-row`
  - `session-tracker-row-stat`
