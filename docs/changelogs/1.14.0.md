Elegance has never been met like this before

## Features

- Added `/link`
  - Unlike `/verify`, `/link` links you Discord and Blitz accounts across all servers
  - This command does not change your nickname
  - `/link` now simply displays a deprecation message
  - Usernames can still be inputted per-command to override your linked account
- `/stats` and `/full-stats` are now way simpler
  - `/stats <type> <period>` has been replaced with `/stats <30|60|90|...>` (likewise, `/full-stats`)
  - These commands now have filters without having to opt into `multi-tank`
- Added `/breakdown`
  - Unlike `/today`, `/breakdown` lets you select any period of time
  - `/breakdown` now simply displays a deprecation message
