# Blitzkrieg 1.16.1

Armor sandbox gains 25% rendering speed and 40% memory efficiency with added accuracy and features.

## Features

- Multiple layers of spaced armors are now calculated properly by the visual armor highlighting
- Added opaque mode to view armor highlighting without any transparency
- Added breakdown on layers of armor penetrated
  - Penetration of each layer is shown represented by a color and an index
    - Green: penetration
    - Red: blocked
    - Yellow: ricochet
  - This also shows layers encountered after a ricochet

## Fixes

- Accuracy now doesn't drop the further the shot is placed from the origin
- HE shells no longer loose penetration like how HEAT shells do when traveling between layers of armor
- Persistent settings are now merged in the correct order making them truly persistent now
- Enhanced armor and calibrated shells are now properly synced from the get go

## Technical Changes

- Spaced armor and external module scenes have been merged
  - They now use additive blending
  - Colors are now normalized by the penetration value instead of maximum armor plate thickness
- Shell normalization now doesn't violate arccosine's domain
