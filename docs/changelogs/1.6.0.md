# Blitzkrieg 1.6.0

Spread the beauty! Spread the ease!

## Features

- Commands no longer require you to provide an username
  - They are automatically inferred from your Discord nickname
- Re-implemented the `/eligible` command
  - This command checks a player's eligibility for any of the Skilled clans
  - This command is only available in the [Skilled](https://discord.gg/ZPvcEG7DS8) and [TresAbhi Discord](https://discord.gg/nDt7AjGJQH) servers
- Gave `/ownedtanks` and `/inactive` the new Blitzkrieg look
- Added "Powered by Wargaming" to commands where Blitz Stars is not utilized

## Fixes

- Removed image encoding all together
  - As it turns out, encoding them in `base64` made rendering slower!
- Tank images in `/today` now don't make parent rows incorrectly taller
- Added a "No tanks found" when a player does not own tanks in a tier

## Technical Changes

- Added a mature error handling system
  - Commands can now just `throw errorWithCause(...)` without caring about the error reporting to the user
