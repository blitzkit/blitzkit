# BlitzKit 1.22.3

This should've been in the last update lol.

## Features

- The "meta information" section has been moved to the hero section on larger screens
- Added an option to take a screenshot directly to the clipboard
- Removed the number from the BlitzKit logo
- The tank playground now stops rendering when it is offscreen, hence fixing a lot of crashes

## Fixes

- The hero section of the Tankopedia is now better sized on smaller screens
- The shell penetration over distance slider now instantly updates the corresponding input instead after a delay
- The game mode banner info is now visible on Apple devices
