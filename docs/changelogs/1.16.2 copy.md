# Blitzkrieg 1.16.2

¡Hola desde el mundo del español!

## Features

- Added translations for Spanish to the bot
  - Your language will be inferred automatically from your Discord settings
  - Any untranslated languages and words we forgot to translate will be left in English
  - If you have your language set to Spanish and see English in any places, please let us know on [the official Discord server](https://discord.gg/nDt7AjGJQH)
  - All `/about` commands except for `commands` remain in English
  - Tank names are still in English
  - The website remains unchanged
- The title bar (featured as the big text on top of most commands) has now been made more compact

## Changes

- "Tank type" is now called "tank class"
- Removed `/player-achievements` and `search-tanks`
  - They will be reintroduced in the future in a far better way
  - Also removed a `SKLLD` server exclusive `/eligible` command
    - This will be generalized for all clans in the future

## Fixes

- Fixed the red glowing floor underneath the tank sandbox
  - This has been replaced with a static image
- The refresh button is now properly removed when lacking permissions
- Tank names that start with a number are now properly inferred from command inputs

## Technical Changes

- Command registration is now error tolerant meaning that if a single command fails to initiate, it will be discarded until the next restart
  - We are currently looking into how we can allow the command to retry registration after a fixed amount of time
- Due to the implications of the code added which can be very easily exploited by hackers, a single file has been added to the repository as a closed source submodule and will remain closed unless a third party open-source implementation is made public
- Removed preview commands
