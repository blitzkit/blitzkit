# Blitzkrieg 1.7.0

This is mostly a technical update to make migrating to cyclic.sh easier.

## Changes

- The bot's new deferred caching approach allows the bot to start up almost `4x` as fast

## Technical Changes

- Made numerous caches non-blocking
  - Removed an unnecessary root-blocking await where fonts are imported
    - Further improved performance by deferring font imports until after the declaration
  - Tank averages and tankopedia are now declared fully empty only to be populated after a deferred fetch
- Reordered error handler, client login, and client event listener registration orders
- Removed `vite` all together
  - This reduces bundle sizes
  - To do this, a more primitive way of importing commands is used
- Removed the redundant usage of `args` to get the Discord token and Wargaming Application ID on each use
- Added a build script using `esbuild`
