This update only affects the website.

## Features

- Added a new foggy-wireframe transition between tabs to smooth out the jarring jumps
- Added animations pop-in and out animations on a few elements
  - The tank name title now shrinks in size as soon as a disturbance is caused
  - The shell selector, antagonist switcher, and thicknesses range now ease into frame
- The Tankopedia search page now loads as a skeleton by default before populating with tanks, allowing for the recently viewed tanks to load without cumulative shift
  - Something similar was done to the Gallery tool
- Gave the meta section of the website some zest with nation-based backdrops
- The compare tabs in the Tankopedia are now centered

## Fixes

- The camera no longer snaps to the initial position when switching between tabs

## Technical Changes

- Backported some technologies from BlitzKit Reforged; you will not notice any differences in usage
- The popular tanks and gallery indexings have been moved to the asynchronous cron job
