# Blitzkrieg 1.5.0

So so many **quality-of-life** changes and nasty **bug squashes**!

## Changes

- Added WN8 to `/today`, `/stats`, and `/tankstats`
- Added average tier to `/stats` and `/tankstats`
  - Average tier in `/tankstats` is simply the tier of the tank that you are looking up
- Added an indicator of WN8 ranging from "very bad" (gray) to "super unicum" (purple)
- Replaced ellipses with simple clipping
- Added a "large image" warning to `/today` if displaying `6` or more tanks

## Fixes

- Removed random 0 that'd show up in `/today` where there was no difference between career and today's stats
- Added stricter checks for username autocomplete via a new REGEX pattern
- Fixed wonky ellipses that'd cut off usernames, tank names, and clan names unnecessarily
- Fixed the delta indicator showing up in battle counts

## Technical Changes

- Optimized and cleaned up tankopedia cache
