# BlitzKit 1.23.0

I rewrote the whole website for performance and lower bandwidth. This update does not affect the bot. If I did my job right, you should not notice a difference.

## Changes

- Removed documentation website, all the docs are now available within https://blitzkit.app/
- Removed the Rating tool
- Removed the ability to log in with Patreon
- Removed all ads

## Technical Changes

- Converted BlitzKit to a monorepo
- The whole website is now static with no server-side rendering
  - Gotta go fast âš¡
- All structural data is now stored in protocol buffers
