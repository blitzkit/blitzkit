# Blitzkrieg 1.14.3

Pull your brush out and start polishing.

## Changes

![HisRoyalFatness' career breakdown](https://i.imgur.com/GhgMTnS.png)

- Rows in `/breakdown` are now chunked into `8` per image
  - This is true unless the number of pages exceeds `10` in which case the rows are even distributed across all `10` pages
  - `10` is the maximum number of images that Discord allows
- Short region names are used in username autocomplete instead of their full names
  - Example: "North America" is "NA" now

## Fixes

- Removed reference to username inference in the username option description
- Removed an unnecessary type `asd` that did absolutely nothing used nowhere

## Technical changes

- Image orders are now preserved even if processed in parallel and all completed out of order
- `fetchBlitz` is now throttled to `10` requests per second
  - Request overflows are managed by queueing
