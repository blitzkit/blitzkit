# BlitzKit 1.25.3

## Features

- Added a "popular tanks" list under the Tankopedia link on the homepage
- The render engine has been sped up by about 50% thanks to cheaper lighting

  - This compares each stat against other tanks of the same class & tier, tier, or every other tank
- Added a recently viewed tanks list to the Tankopedia tank pages

## Fixes

- The shot result card is now displayed in the sandbox even on mobile devices now
- Removed ad settings and referenced from the policies prompt
- Removed draco compression as it usually only saved about 0.7mb per tank but added an extra 1mb to the decompressor
- The tank type colors are back in the tank search
- Frames are once again rendered when posing tanks
- Removed the "ghost column" in the Session tool
- The "total" cell is now sticky too much-like the tank name cells
- The reset button in the tank search now resets the sort as well
- The provisions list is now centered on smaller screens
- The navbar can once again be scrolled
- Provisions and consumables are no longer off by 1
  - Allow up to 24 hours for this to update as BlitzKit re-syncs with the game
