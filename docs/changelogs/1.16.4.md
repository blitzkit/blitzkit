# Blitzkrieg 1.16.4

A few issues here and there addressed for good measure.

## Changes

- Armor layer penetration indices are now much more compact.

## Fixes

- Reverted splash mechanics changes from `1.16.1` as it made them less accurate.
- Auto-reloaders now report their DPM stats correctly with crew training.

## Technical Changes

- All files in the project were reviewed and constant exports were isolated.
- The downloaded game in the workflow now also includes the latest patches.
- Asset building now uses sharp under the hood which should in theory be faster.
- Fetching CDON LZ4 files now uses `no-store` instead of `no-cache`
