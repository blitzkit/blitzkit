# BlitzKit 1.25.4

## Features

- The popular tanks list on the homepage now uses a better algorithm such that it doesn't exclude low tier

## Fixes

- Clipping potential is once again rounded to the nearest integer
- Raw hard terrain coefficients are now flagged as "lower the better," hence bringing it to parity with the terrain percentages
- The renderer now doesn't brighten the tank too much
- The recently viewed tanks is list no longer displayed in compact mode (in places like the Compare tool)
- Tank ids once again populate the URL making it easily shareable
- The number of tanks no longer double each time a file is saved in dev mode
  - Lol tankopedia once had 662 \* 2 ^ 18 = 173 million tanks loaded on my dying pc
