# BlitzKit 1.27.0

PLEASE HELP TRANSLATE BLITZKIT: https://crowdin.com/project/blitzkrieg

This update will be the last major update before the release of World of Tanks Blitz Unreal Engine.

## Features

- Added support for English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, and Chinese to the website and bot
  - You can switch languages through the home page, the footer of any page, or the settings page

I know this change log is small but this update was HUGE with a total of 7500 lines of code changes, this was annoying as hell, but worth it!
