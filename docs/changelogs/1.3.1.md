# Blitzkrieg 1.3.1

In this **minor update**, Blitzkrieg received several little **safety features** and **bug fixes**!

- The bot is now more verbose
  - Every time you use a command, the bot will now store data on what parameters you provided and if any errors were caused
- This update also eliminates the redundant usage of truthy type checking after API calls
  - _Hopefully_ the bot let you know why it won't respond to you
