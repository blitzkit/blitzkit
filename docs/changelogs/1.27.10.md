# BlitzKit 1.27.10

This update changes the URLs across the whole website, removing the "tools" prefix and simplifying other aspects too.

## Changes

- Removed "full" tank names
  - For example, tanks like the "Carro 45t" had full names like "Carro Combattimento 45t" which remained pretty much unused, so they have been removed
- Reduced the shadow below the navigation bar
- Removed the "tools" prefix from the URLs; here are the paths:
  - `/tools/tankopedia` -> `/tanks`
  - `/tools/tankopedia/12345` -> `/tanks/tank-name`
  - `/tools/compare` -> `/compare`
  - `/tools/embed` -> `/embed`
  - `/tools/embed/embed-name` -> `/embed/embed-name`
  - `/tools/gallery` -> `/gallery`
  - `/tools/performance` -> `/performance`
  - `/tools/session` -> `/session`
  - `/tools/tier-list` -> `/tier-list`

## Technical Features

- The asset mangler now uses http headers and even more heuristics to minimize re-creating unchanged assets
