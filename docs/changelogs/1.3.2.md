# Blitzkrieg 1.3.2

From now on, I **won't be pinging** the Blitzkrieg role for minor updates. Anyway, this **minor update** includes an optimization for `/today`. The tank icons on the left were fetched every time someone used the command. The bot now caches those images allowing for an instantaneous load.

I noticed rendering times up to `3000ms` for rendering stats of about 10 tanks. Cached images should now be indifferent to this.
