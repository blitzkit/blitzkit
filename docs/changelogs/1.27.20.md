# BlitzKit 1.27.20

It's all technical updates! The HD tanks will be rolled out over the span of few days.

## Technical Changes

- Shadows are disabled if your framerate drops below 30fps
- Pages that redirect to other pages (like the old /tools/tankopedia) now load a few hundred times faster
- Replaced Zustand with a custom state manager called Varuna with the goal to rewrite a significant portion of the website to not require any React for rendering increasing performance
- The transition wireframe in the Tankopedia sandbox now uses a lower quality model for performance reasons
- Tanks with PBR now use the correct maximum resolution textures
  - This is a significant update as you can now literally see individual splats of dust on tanks and scratches haha
- Baked the ambient occlusion maps into the textures, hence reducing the overall model load times even with higher resolution textures
