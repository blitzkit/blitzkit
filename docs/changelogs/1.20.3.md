# BlitzKit 1.20.3

A bug turns into a rating command feature!

## Features

- The rating command was giving seasonal statistics instead for the current day; this bug has now been made a feature through the new `/rating season` command

## Fixes

- Missing WN8 is now displayed with "--" instead of `NaN`
- Players who have not participated in the rating gamemode are handled correctly
- Decreasing position is now positive indicated in `/rating`
- `/rating` now displays today's statics correctly once again
