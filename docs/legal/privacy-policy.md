# BlitzKit Privacy Policy

BlitzKit collects little to no data. Regardless, here is an exhaustive list of BlitzKit's data collection practices.

## Logs

All BlitzKit logs are available to the public as an effort for open source transparency. A history of all logs [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/tresabhi/blitzkit/actions/workflows/host.yml). All logs expire automatically and are permanently deleted after 30 days. However, anyone may chose to save a local copy of the logs which is not tracked by GitHub.

## Commands

Everytime a command a command is used, the command name and parameters provided is logged. Any identifying information like manually provided in-game usernames are also recorded.

## Databases

No databases are used by BlitzKit meaning that no data is collected outside of what has already been mentioned above. This is no permanent state.

## 3rd Party

The privacy policies of Discord, Wargaming, and Blitz Stars apply too since they are utilized by the bot.
