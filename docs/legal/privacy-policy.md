# Blitzkrieg Privacy Policy

Blitzkrieg collects little to no data. Regardless, here is an exhaustive list of Blitzkrieg's data collection practices.

## Logs

All Blitzkrieg logs are available to the public as an effort for open source transparency. A history of all logs [can be found on GitHub](https://github.com/tresabhi/blitzkrieg/actions/workflows/host.yml). All logs expire automatically and are permanently deleted after 30 days. However, anyone may chose to save a local copy of the logs which is not tracked by GitHub.

## Commands

Everytime a command a command is used, the command name and parameters provided is logged. Any identifying information like manually provided in-game usernames are also recorded.

## Errors

Everytime an error occurs, a detailed stack trace, scope of the error, and the error message is logged both in the GitHub logs and in the public channel [#ðŸ”²ï¸±blitzkrieg-logs](https://discord.com/channels/734786591205359697/880650462540476416) in [the official Discord server](https://discord.gg/nDt7AjGJQH).

## Databases

No databases are used by Blitzkrieg meaning that no data is collected outside of what has already been mentioned above. This is no permanent state.

## 3rd Party

The privacy policies of Discord, Wargaming, and Blitz Stars apply too since they are utilized by the bot.
