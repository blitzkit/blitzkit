# Inviting the Bot

It's quite simple really. Just follow the steps below:

1. Join a Discord server that already has Blitzkrieg installed or [the official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nDt7AjGJQH).
2. Click on the bot's profile.
3. Click the "Add to Server" button under the bot's name and ID.
4. Select what server you want it in and see what permissions you seem fit for the bot.

Voila! You're ready to go.
