# Embeds

Embeds are generated by a few commands as a URL that can be loaded in a browser/streaming software.

## Creating Embeds

1. Use a command of your liking (for example, `/stats`).
2. Customize the command however you like and the URL generated for the embed will match your needs.
3. Send the command and when the bot is "done thinking," an "Embed" button will appear below the bot's reply.

## Using Embeds in Streaming Softwares

1. Click on the "Embed" button.
2. Copy the URL from your browser.
3. Paste the URL into a Browser Source.
4. Set the refresh rate/FPS to something very low like `0.0167` (that's 1 frame every 60 seconds).

## How Embeds Behave

- They load like any normal website albeit with a significant delay.
- They auto refresh every `60s`.
- All embeds and images generated by Blitzkrieg have a width of `640px` but the height varies and must be found manually through trial and error.
  - It's okay to have a Browser Source that has a height larger than needed as Blitzkrieg embeds are transparent.
