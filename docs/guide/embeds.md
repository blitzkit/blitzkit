# Embeds

Embeds are URLs generated by commands or tools that represent the "naked" version of the respective command or tool

## Creating Embeds

1. Use a command or tool and click on "Embed" if it's available
2. Make sure to tweak the settings of the command or tool because embeds replicate everything

## Using Embeds in Streaming Softwares

1. Click on the "Embed" button
   - If this was generated by a command, copy the URL from the browser
   - If this was generated by a tool, the URL has been copied to your clipboard already
2. Paste this URL into your streaming service as a "Browser Source"
   - Tool embeds use local storage so data won't be transferred from you browser to your streaming software
   - Make sure to visit the tool's page in your streaming software (using the "Interact" feature) and then open the embed
   - Set your browser source refresh rate to `1Hz` because that's how fast embeds refresh

## How Embeds Behave

- They load like any normal website
- They auto refresh every `1s`
