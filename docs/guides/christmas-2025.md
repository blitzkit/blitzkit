# Christmas Garage Guide 2025

This content was pre-recorded on a test server and the version you may see may not be the same. Please see [the official WoTB portal](https://wotblitz.com/) for the most up-to-date information.

The holiday season has arrived, and this year the celebrations spill directly into your garage, transforming the familiar space into a festive hub filled with activities, rewards, and seasonal flair. Instead of just offering decorations or a visual makeover, this event brings a full set of mechanics that turn everyday battles into a steady stream of progress. Whether you’re aiming for bonuses, collectibles, or new tanks, the garage is designed to make every match feel like part of a larger holiday journey.

## The Music Box

The familiar Snow Globes are absent this year, replaced entirely by **Music Boxes**, which act as the new way to try your luck for seasonal rewards. They behave similarly to the Snow Globes and give you a chance to obtain various items, including a shot at the brand-new **[GSOR the TANK](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/gsor-the-tank/)**. But this time around, **they do not guarantee a tank every single time.** But as a bonus, the Music Box guarantees you will not receive duplicate tanks. Once you have a tank, the Music Box will try its best to give you a different one each time.

## Win Battles, Earn Rewards

Each victory during the event rewards you with **3 Hot Coffees**, a seasonal currency that serves as the backbone of the progression system. These coffees can be exchanged for a variety of Festive Town rewards, giving you reasons to keep pushing through battles even if you’re just casually playing.

With the coffees, you’ll also be able to claim **2 tank certificates**, one for **tier VII** vehicles and another covering **tier IX–X** options.

The tier VII pool includes the [E 25](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/e-25), [CS-52 LIS](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/cs-52-lis), [AMX 13 57](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/amx-13-57), [Steyr WT](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/steyr-wt), [Kunze Panzer](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/kunze-panzer), and [Super Hellcat](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/super-hellcat). Meanwhile, the tier IX–X certificate gives access to higher-tier picks like the [121B](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/121b), [AMX 30 B](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/amx-30-b), [Obj. 260](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/obj-260), [Char Futur 4](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/char-futur-4), [TL-7-120](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/tl-7-120), and [Object 452K](https://blitzkit.app/tanks/object-452k).

## Upgrade Your Christmas Tree

Golden tokens allow you to upgrade your Christmas Tree through **four distinct stages**, each bringing your garage closer to its fully decorated holiday form.

As the tree grows, additional ornament slots open up, eight in total, which appear on the left side of your screen. These slots give you more room to customize the look of your garage and make the tree feel like something you’ve built up piece by piece over the course of the event. Each new ornament adds to the atmosphere, making the progression feel both cosmetic and rewarding.

A fully decorated tree grants up to **+25% silver** per battle, turning your regular gameplay into a more profitable experience without requiring extra effort. Ensure all your ornaments come from the same set to unlock the full potential of the tree (all left, all middle, or all right).

## Upgrade Your Yuletide Stall

Your golden tokens can also be invested into upgrading the **Yuletide Stall**, another element of the garage that evolves as you level it up. Each upgrade unlocks new rewards, giving you incentives to distribute your tokens across different attractions instead of focusing on only one. The stall begins in a simple state, but after upgrades it transforms visually and functionally, becoming a more vibrant part of your garage.

Each upgrade unlocks a tier worth of rewards that you can claim in exchange for Free XP, Gold, Silver, and more Hot Coffees!

## Upgrade Your Shooting Gallery

Another upgradeable area is the **Shooting Gallery**, which contributes its own set of rewards as it levels up. Enhancing the gallery expands your options for exchanging mastery badges, making those badges more useful during the event than they usually are.
